# Next Run Priorities

1. ACF-917 Complete world/public auth policy split + stream backpressure instrumentation.
2. ACF-909 Thread/session continuity contract.
3. ACF-910 WS transport parity with SSE semantics.
4. ACF-913 Structured handoff UX.
5. ACF-914 Coordination observability + SLOs.

## Definition of done for next run
- World edge protections are explicit and documented for public traffic.
- Thread context continuity is deterministic across reconnect/restart.
- WS/SSE transport parity is documented and validated.
