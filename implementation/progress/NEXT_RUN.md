# Next Run Priorities

1. ACF-803: operator override panel MVP.
2. ACF-104: presence event schema stabilization.
3. ACF-701: tasks/quests domain model + API.
4. ACF-804: operator audit trail.
5. ACF-504: domain validation error expansion.

## Definition of done for next run
- Operator actions can pause room, mute agent, and force leave with audit metadata.
- Presence events use a documented and validated normalized schema.
- Quests/tasks can be created, assigned, and progressed in-room.
- Operator actions produce immutable audit events queryable by time and room.
- Domain validation failures return typed, field-level error details.
